# Guide to Using the File Concatenation Script

This Python script concatenates the contents of all files with a specified extension within a given directory (and its subdirectories) into a single output file. It adds headers and footers to separate the content from each file.

## Features
- Recursively searches for files with a specific extension in a given directory.
- Concatenates the contents of those files into a single output file.
- Adds markers indicating the start and end of each file's content.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `os` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Usage

### 1. How the Script Works

- The script defines a function `concatenate_files_with_extension` that takes three parameters:
  - `directory`: The path to the directory to search for files.
  - `extension`: The file extension to filter which files to concatenate (e.g., `.txt`).
  - `output_file`: The path to the output file where the concatenated content will be written.
