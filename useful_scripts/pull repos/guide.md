# Guide to Using the Git Pull Script

This bash script automates the process of running `git pull` on multiple Git repositories located in a specific base directory. It scans for all repositories, runs `git pull`, and reports the result for each one.

## Features
- Automatically finds all Git repositories in a given base directory.
- Executes `git pull` for each repository found.
- Reports whether the pull was successful or if an error occurred.

## Usage

### 1. Directory Structure

The script assumes that all the local repositories are located within a specific base directory. This base directory can contain multiple subdirectories, each representing a Git repository.

### 2. How the Script Works

- The script defines the `BASE_DIR`, which points to the directory containing your local Git repositories. Modify this line to point to the correct location on your system:
  
```bash
BASE_DIR="/your/base/directory/here"
